            <h2>Is this really legal?</h2>
            <p>Under the 2018 Farm Bill, hemp products are federally legal as long as they contain less than 0.3% Delta-9 THC by dry weight.</p>
            <p>Every Pine Park product is tested by independent labs. Certificates of Analysis (COAs) are available right on our product pages and linked via QR codes on our packaging. No detours, no filler websites — just direct access to real lab results.</p>
            <p>Every product is carefully crafted and rigorously tested to ensure it meets this strict legal requirement, so you can enjoy with confidence and peace of mind. Trust is non-negotiable for us and we share the test results to prove it!</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Order Fulfillment & Delivery Confirmation</strong><br>
                    Orders are typically processed within 1–3 business days (excluding weekends and holidays).<br>
                    Once your package is marked as “Delivered” by the shipping carrier, it is considered fulfilled and complete.<br>
                    If you believe your package was delivered incorrectly, please reach out within 72 hours so we can help investigate.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Lost or Stolen Packages</strong><br>
                    If your package shows as delivered but you didn’t receive it, please check with neighbors or your local carrier first.<br>
                    If it’s confirmed missing or stolen, we require a police report to process any refund or replacement request. This helps protect both you and our business from fraudulent activity.<br>
                    The report must be submitted to us within 3 business days of the delivery date.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Damaged Items</strong><br>

                    Be sure to include clear photos or video of the damaged item and packaging so we can help make it right.<br>
                    Claims submitted after this window or without documentation may not be eligible for refund or replacement.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Shipping Insurance</strong><br>
                    We offer optional shipping insurance at checkout for added peace of mind.<br>
                    Orders without shipping insurance may not qualify for compensation if lost, stolen, or damaged after shipment.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Incorrect Address Policy</strong><br>
                    Please double-check your shipping address at checkout.<br>
                    We are not responsible for delays or losses due to incorrect or incomplete addresses provided by the customer.
